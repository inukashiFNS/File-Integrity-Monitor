# File-Integrity-Monitor
A File Integrity Monitor made using Powershell.

PowerShell FIM ToDo List (Too Improve)
1.) If we start monitoring a baseline even if does not exist. This throws error as this is not coded, so update this.
2.) Letting the user choose, which folder to monitor.
3.) Do recurssive file checking , so the script dives deep into the file structure and check for integrity.
4.) If their is no baseline and user starts to check file integrity. This causes error in current case. So make a good flow control, where if baseline does not exist then redirect user to create a baseline.
5.) Instead of printing messages can send notifications or emails.
